name is Łukasz Olender and I'm a 33 years old computer programmer living in Chorzów, Poland.\n\n\nThis is me!\n\nI was born here on 13th of November 1990. I have three siblings -- I'm the oldest one. I had a beautiful childhood during which I've spent a lot of time on the countryside, in a small summerhouse in moutains.\nOn 1998, I started my 12 years long music journey by signing up to Music School. Such an endeavor shaped me a lot. While I'm not considering myself a professional musican, I do think that I'm pretty good at time management because of extra time pressure that was on me since my early school days. Besides that, I can play clarinet pretty well - I was first clarinetist in city folk band (Zespół Pieśni i Tańca Chorzów) and in municipal orchestra of Chorzów (Miejska Orkiestra Chorzów). As of today, sometimes I still play clarinet but not as often as I used to. I'm also not practicing regularly.\nI studied Computer Science at the Silesian University Of Technology in Gliwice. I graduated in 2013. I have Master Degree.\nApart from University, I was loving MOOCs (well, I still love them but don't have time for them anymore). I finished \"Artificial Intelligence\" by Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig from Stanford University in the fall of 2011. I think that was one of first MOOCs ever.\n\n\nI nailed it, didn't I? 😊\n\nI participated in many MOOCs, some of them completed, some of them only partially finished. See my recommendations page!\nDuring my University adventure, I also took an opportunity to create a small startup about which you can read here and here.\nStarting from January 2012 I started my career as a software developer in Euvic. In 2016 I moved to Shiji where I work now as technical leader of a team of 18.\nI like everything connected to software development - from low-level algorithms and data structures to modeling high-level business concepts. From fine-tuned imperative procedures, to big object-oriented services playing well together. I led and developed a couple of interesting projects about which you can read in my CV.\nBesides programming, I love skiing, playing casual songs on piano, hiking and roller-skating. I wish I had more time 😊\n\n\nI like skiing!\n\n","id":"https://lukiasz.github.io/about/","title":"About"},"https://lukiasz.github.io/blog/":{"body":"","id":"https://lukiasz.github.io/blog/","title":""},"https://lukiasz.github.io/blog/iterating-on-concept/":{"body":"You might have seen this picture before:\n\n\n\nIt's usually mentioned in the context of discussing Agile vs Waterfall to make an argument that we should iteratively build a product that solves some business needs from some early days rather than create a software that won't render any value unless fully finished. But is it always the case? Is delivering some value early always the best way of developing software?\nThe cost of delivering early\nSome people tend to think:\n\nLet's do a skateboard to make customer somewhat happy, phase 1, and we'll think later.\n\nwithout considering:\n\nIs spending time on designing and implementing skateboard... then scooter... then bicycle... then bike... really the fastest way to build a car?\n\nI've seen couple of times a temptation of focusing on intermediate, easy checkpoint while purposefully avoiding thinking about the end goal.\nIn those cases, eagerness of delivering something working makes us forget that the overall process of making rollerskate -&gt; scooter -&gt; bicycle -&gt; bike -&gt; car will take more resources than doing just a car at the beginning. It's simply more work to build all of those things in-between.\nWhat's even more, business people like to underestimate cost of rework happening in-between when iterating on live product. They think like:\n\n\"- ok, let's build rollerskate, it's simple\"\n\n\n\"- now, add handlebar, it's simple\"\n\n\n...\n\n\n\"- now we have bike, it looks like we need to add two more wheels and that will be a car!\"\n\nThey don't realize that a lot of internals will be rewritten in-between. And developers sometimes don't make it explicit, because they also don't think about that, they like jumping into code sooner than later. It's also motivating for everyone to see some tangible, working things early.\nThe only problem is that this approach, unfortunately, is very expensive. It's called iterating on code.\nIterating on concept vs iterating on code\nIterating On Code goes like this:\n\nDesign feature\nImplement feature\nFeedback loop\n(go to point 1)\n\nThe slowest point is point number 2. You can iterate faster if you take coding out of the loop when prototyping a new feature/product.\nThat would be something like steps below. It's called Iterating On Concept:\n\nDesign feature\nPrototype\nFeedback loop\n(go to point 1)\nImplement final version of the feature\n\nYes, there are cases when it's not possible. There are cases when you need to iterate on code. There are cases that you will build rollerskate, then scooter, bicycle, bike to end up building a car. Sometimes it's the only way to discover what to do next. But it's not always the case. In many, many situations you should hold your horses. Don't jump straight into development but stay longer in design and prototyping phases. Don't be lazy. Iterate on concept whenever possible.\n","id":"https://lukiasz.github.io/blog/iterating-on-concept/","title":"Iterating on Concept vs Iterating on Code"},"https://lukiasz.github.io/blog/perfect-code/":{"body":"One of thoughts that came to my mind some time ago was the conflict between spending more time on perfect code vs iterating quickly while having good enough code.\nSo... What is perfect code at all? Can we express it in objective terms meaning that some fragment is perfect or closer to perfection than the other fragment?\n\nConsider two snippets:\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)\n{\n    ...\n}\n\nvs\nvar range = Enumerable.Range(0, n).Select(x =&gt; ...);\n\nThere are multiple people with different mindsets, experiences, personal tastes, and so on. But... If there would be an omniscient programming god who could judge - which snippet would he choose?\nYou can't judge code without knowing context\nAnd the answer is... the first one!\nJust kidding 😊. No one can answer to that question without knowing the context. The first fragment is doing something, and the second one is doing something else. One can explain what the computer will do when executing these of two fragments - how it'll be interpreted, what would be the result, maybe some performance characteristics and other details and... that's it. Can't objectively tell which one is better.\nWe're writing the code to solve some problems, and without knowing the problem, we can't judge the code. For the sake of the argument, imagine these fragments being sent to The International Obfuscated C Code Contest. Both of them would be totally bad because they aren't obfuscated at all, and they're not even written in C. But even without going to such extremes, the answer is still not obvious. Maybe we could start asking whether such code was part of some performance-critical library? Or maybe that doesn't matter even in that case? Maybe the n is small and the code is not on the hot path at all?\nThe example is just a loop written in two flavors. In the everyday life, we're choosing from an infinite number of possible solutions that require more analysis. How on earth could anyone say which fragment of code is better without knowing the context?\nYou need to judge the solution\nThese isn't just perfect code without the problem that it solves, but I guess there could be a perfect solution to a given problem, available for those who know the entire state of the universe 😊 Exploring problem domain – sometimes interesting, sometimes laborious work – must suffice for the rest of us 😊. Quite a big part of working as a programmer is uncovering the problem. The more variables you take into consideration, the better solution you can create.\nAnd that better solution might be non-obvious and beyond those of us who don't bother. Sometimes it does not include writing any code at all – or quite contrary – requires some additional code that might look as unnecessary at first glance.\nNot every customer requirement has to be satisfied by writing more and more lines of code (which require more hours to maintain). That's the power of knowing well the domain in which you implement the software – quite often you can solve the problem in a different way than originally planned.\nEvery now and then implementing more generic mechanisms and functionalities pays off. But in many scenarios it doesn't. Sometimes it would pay off but you can't generalize it because you don't have enough skills and you don't even know how to do it. If knowing the context is the king, knowing your craftmanship is the queen.\nSummary\nYou write the code to solve the problem, not just write the code for the sake of writing the code. You judge others code from the perspective how well is solves the problem you have.\nHave a nice day! 😊\n","id":"https://lukiasz.github.io/blog/perfect-code/","title":"Does your code has to be perfect?"},"https://lukiasz.github.io/blog/wtm-post-mortem/":{"body":"This page describes a brief history of one of the most interesting after-hour projects that I've been involved with. It was called Way To Master and it was intended to help learning English for Polish people. Nothing related to it happened for a two years from now. There are no users, no ads, no new features. Also, there is one week left until domain will expire so probably now the page you're reading is one of few visible signs of existence of Way To Master. I'm writing this post mostly for myself in the future. There will be a point in my life when I'll forget some of these things and then I'll just open it and read :-).\n\n\n\nI've split this article into two separate posts. The first one (that you're reading right now) is overall description of the project. The second one explains technicalities and is available here.\n\n\nIn-line translation (.srt format).\n\nLearning foreign languages - standard approach\nWay to master was all about learning foreign languages. And learning a language is a bit twisted phenomena comparing to learning other things. Usually, if you want to learn about some subject, you're using language (either spoken or written) to get familiar with new concepts. A programmer could say that the role of a language here is acting as a transport layer carrying content to learn. By adjusting language, one can gain better understanding of given concept - sometimes learned topics are easier to understand if different words are used and sometimes the opposite holds true.\nIf you're learning a language things are different. What you want to learn is the transport layer and you're doing it by utilizing some content - articles, sentences, songs, movies, dialogues. Whatever way of learning a language you will use, you need something to read, write, speak or hear about. \nIf you prefer to learn a language using one of most common approaches - stationary course, these somethings to read, write, speak or hear about are usually fixed and provided by a course creators. Sometimes student has limited possibility of choosing one article or another but there are chances that nothing will really meet his areas of interests anyway. It's partially because people are varying on their interests and partially because learning materials need to be adjusted basing on language level.\n\n\nSummary widget displayed after uploading new subtitles.\n\nLearning foreign languages - our approach\nThe core idea behind Way To Master was to allow to use any materials for learning foreign languages.\nUser was supposed to upload original content and then few things were happening:\n\nContent was analyzed from the language perspective - words were categorized to known and unknown for the particular user basing on his pervious experience with the system,\nUnknown words were translated directly in content (depending of content type - differently for movies subtitles, differently for ebooks),\nUnknown words were saved in database with their contexts (one or few surrounding sentences),\nUnknown words were added into built-in spaced repetitions system.\n\nNow, user could:\n\nDownload modified content with translations,\nDownload flashcards with translations and words contexts,\nLearn unknown words on the webpage or directly mark them as known.\n\nThe learning cycle for the user consisted of:\n\nUploading, downloading and utilizing modified content - watching movies, playing computer games, reading e-books,\nComing back to system few times in a week to make repetitions of learned words.\n\n\n\nTop screen translating (.ass format).\n\nThe big picture\nThe goal was to have a system supporting learning popular languages with an additional boost of experiencing content thaat a particular person finds interesting. That should make the whole process of language acquisition more convenient and similar to how people are learning new languages when they for example migrate to other countries. I couldn't emphasize that more - just please hold on for a moment and imagine - doesn't it look like a way of learning languages that will anyway come up at one time in the future? People playing computer games, watching movies, reading books AND learning languages by the way... The idea was (is?) very alluring, at least for me.\n\n\nList of words occurring in some subtitles.\n\nEarly stages\nDuring spring of 2013, I and few friends from the same university group created a desktop application that could read text files, extract words from them and synchronize state with remote server. It was focused mostly on movies subtitles but parser was quite generic (it basically cut off all of strings which were not dictionary-based words) and it worked also for most of plain-text based formats. We never showed that for anyone except our professor - this project was purely for university and we didn't thought of it as a any kind of startup or after-hours project.\nThen, for our bachelor degree, we implemented a little extended version with a web interface. Never released, only for university. After that, me and my friend Wojtek decided to give it a try and release it to the public and that's where the startup chapter starts.\n\n\nOur landing page.\n\nFinal stage\nBeginning of 2014 was time in Poland of everyone doing their internet startups :-), There were a lot of conferences related to this topic there and a lot of buzz about it. Everyone was doing landing pages so we decided to do a landing page before we complete final version. So we did a landing page :-). Publishing a real service was a little harder than we thought; yet we had a lot of fun doing side quests - like spending days trying to host our solution on linux in one of Polish small cloud provider or asking random people whether they like the idea. At some point in time we decided to reshape the idea and accomplish something simpler. Driven by all startup gurus advices, we felt that we need to find our target group and focus mostly on them. So we picked:\n\nMovies subtitles only\nPeople speaking in Polish language which are learning English\n\nWe did it under assumption: If we can interest polish people with only such a product, it proves that it's worth doing.\nSpeaking about work - I was mostly responsible for logic of parsing files, extracting words and putting translations in-place. Wojtek was mostly doing frontend and database-related logic (saving words knowledge, comparing knowledge with what was in new files).\n\n    \n        \n    \n    Desktop application was making subtitle translating cycle easier.\n\nAt the beginning of October, we finally put our application to the real world. In October 28, 2014, we put it on Polish reddit-like page called Wykop. We've received over 800 upvotes which at this time was a pretty good result. It converted to over 30 000 visits on our page on a first few days (at least this is what Google Analytics shown us).\nInitial week consisted of a little over 1400 new registrations in our application. We were very excited about that. People were saying good things about the idea and execution (obviously there was also some negative opinions but overall feedback was good) and we felt great about it.\nThe question then was - what should be next stage and how to proceed?\n\n    \n        \n    \n    We even released our own version of popcorn time :-)\n\nTrying to get attention\nWe've won a local startup competition (Dig Up Start Up in Katowice) and tried interest few VCs in Poland. Unfortunately, without a success. People seemed not to be particularly interested in building a global service aiming to change the way of people are learning languages. Mostly because the road to monetize was not clear to them and also because road was not clear for us. Or maybe I sold the idea badly? There are huge number of smaller and bigger flashcards-online applications and once you say flashcard and learning, people seem to recollect memories of all of these websites and apps and try to think like: ok, that's something like this plus something extra. It was hard to convince people we've met that having few thousands of free subscriptions actually proves anything valuable for them. Also, it looked like some of registered people were just testing our system using it few times and then never going back again. There was no sign of money inside of Way To Master at this stage. We needed to push it to next level. At this time we still received a number of new subscriptions but it started becoming obvious that we need to focus on broader group rather than only Poles trying to learn English. Also, relying on subtitles for movies coming from not 100% legal sources wasn't obviously the best predictor when it comes to monetizing application :-). \nEnd of project\nDue to our implementation, it would require to re-write a lot of parts of the system in order to support more than English language. At this time both me and Wojtek were studying and working part-time and we decided to not continue. Actually, there was no decision per se that we stop development - it was rather a continuous blanking of effort. We switched to another activities - partially because we needed money that standard job was giving us and partially because we didn't see a next realistic goal.\nIt was somewhere about May, 2015. Since then, service was active until now, that is - September 2017.\nFew statistics:\n\n4379 registered accounts,\n10894 unique uploaded and translated subtitles,\n30367202 recognized words that were either known or not known by users,\n11301546 phrases recognized as separate sentences (less than 3 words per sentence, but please remember they came from movies).\n\nLessons learned\nInstead of writing a list of things, I'll write only a single one:\n\nI should do what I believe is the best for the project and not what I suppose to do in the eyes of others.\n\nIf we didn't focus on Polish people only and English language only, we could show it to a greater range of people, including huge range of programmers on Reddit and Hacker News. I believe that someone of them might be interested in the idea - not only using it but also helping us with execution. Yes, it would be harder to complete it in time we did it but the results will probably be more valuable. And even if we decided to leave it, we could make it open-source side project and more people could actually benefit from it.\nIn the next article you can read about technicalities of Way To Master and provide few code samples.\n","id":"https://lukiasz.github.io/blog/wtm-post-mortem/","title":"The history of Way To Master and lessons learned"},"https://lukiasz.github.io/blog/wtm-technicalities/":{"body":"In this post I'll write about implementation details of Way To Master. Your can read about what the system was in previous post. Today I want to briefly describe how things were connected to each other and how some of them were implemented. The overall design wasn't really \"exceptional\" or \"cool\" so you may wonder - why I'm describing it? Well, the main reason is to keep it written down as a reference for me in the future.\n\n\n\nParts of system\nFrom runtime perspective, Way To Master consisted of several blocks.\n\n\nRuntime perspective.\n\nFrontend Application\nFirst application that user could directly interact with was our frontend app. It's responsibility was to handle landing page and  whole frontend logic after logging in. Was written using AngularJS 1. Looked good on desktops and tablets. Only landing page was optimized for phones screens. A bunch of screenshots and some videos are available in previous post.\nFrom code organization perspective it was standard Angular app with controllers, views, models, services and some directives (such as directive for some of displayed words which could be double-clicked to update knowledge state - see a picture below).\n\n\nMoving cursor above word displayed a translation.\n\nPopcorn Time Fork\nNext app for interacting with users was a fork of one of Popcorn Time applications. Popcorn Time is a torrent client that allows for watching movies and tv shows. Our modification pushed and pulled subtitles to and from our server. After starting an application, user put his credentials into out login popup. Then, subtitles for every movie he watched were sent to our server and then downloaded back with proper translations.\nDesktop Application\nThe last client that we wrote was a desktop application for Windows. It was a small tool for making process of uploading/downloading subtitles more convenient. Instead of opening a browser and doing file manipulation there, it allowed for RMB click on subtitles file and selection of new option Translate Hard Words. It was written in C++ and Qt/QML with proper explorer.exe handlers that allowed us to attach to the system right mouse button menu. Why C++? After doing a small prototype we realized that running managed .NET code per every RMB click was a significant overhead. So explorer.exe handler had to be in native code. And since we've got some experience with C++, we decided to just write everything in it.\n\n\nDesktop app - version for translation without logging in (alpha). User could choose how much was translated by selecting stars representing his knowledge of a language.\n\nBackend Application\nIt was the main place where everything interesting was happening. From runtime perspective it was a one thing (it was hosted as a single ASP.NET application) but from logical standpoint a lot of things were going on. If we look at it from domain modelling perspective, it would look like this:\n\n\nBackend code organization perspective.\n\n\n\nLearning Module - Bounded Context containing UserLanguageKnowledge aggregate and several other entities related with maintaining user language knowledge states.\nModel for storing knowledge was actually quite straightforward. Every unique lemma had has its own row representation in words table. Knowledge of given lemma for given user was stored in WordCard entity. Knowledge state was either NotKnown or Known.\nThat design would probably not scale well - at the end we were going to store one row per every English lemma per every user of our application. As stated in previous post, we ended having more than 30 millions of word cards from less than 5 thousands of users. If I was to write it again, I would probably go for jsonb column for the whole user language knowledge. It would be a bit more tricky to implement updating a single word knowledge but it'll probably help in DB performance in a long run.\n\n\nContent Module - Bounded Context containing Content aggregate which represented a single uploaded file with all sentences and words. Model was also quite straightforward. Content had multiple sentences. Every Sentence had collection of words in context. Word In Context contained link to lemma (Word), abstract location data allowing us to find occurrence of this word in uploaded file, id of part of speech and id of synset.\n\n\nUser Profile Module - bunch of services for managing accounts. Some of methods were just wrappers for ASP.NET Membership Provider. From what I remember it required a significant amount of work to make it running with PostgreSQL and Entity Framework back then. The interface of ASP.NET Membership looked like it's basing on on Entity Framework structure entirely but in the reality some internal SQL Server stored procedures were called under the hood :smile:. Looking now into installed NuGet packages I see that we used the pgprovider library. We've been lucky that it worked as expected :smile:.\n\n\nAdministration Module - bunch of services for managing administration tasks.\n\n\nTranslation Module - quite interesting piece. It was a service which was providing translations for words. Translations consisted of... well... translations :-) and word definitions taken from WordNet. We utilized WordReference's APIs with quite aggressive caching so we didn't need to call it per every single word. WordNet database was translated and stored in our PostgreSQL database.\n\n\nWhen we were implementing this, we were learning about how to design object oriented code. Some of design decisions made sense, some not. For example, today I would probably keep Content and Learning bounded contexts together. But from the other hand - what's the point of crafting code that is used by no-one? If I could dedicate another extra minute, I should spent it on crafting value proposition, not on improving the code that was working.\nPostgreSQL\nWell, just PostgreSQL database :-). We didn't use jsonb features and anything more fancy.\nFile Parsing / Translating Services\nIn Way To Master we've been processing subtitles for movies - in two formats - SubRip and SubStation Alpha (the latter one was only as a output format).\n\n\nThanks to SSA format, we could display translations on the top.\n\nObviously, if we wanted to parse and modify content of subtitles, we needed to parse these files correctly. We recognized manipulations on files as a possible bottleneck so we designed code in the way that services for parsing and for inserting translations were quite separated from backend application's code. They were implemented quite good, I remember having great fun writing this part of code. Let me give you a short description.\n\n\nColorful in-line SRT format translations.\n\nIn the backend application part there was a ContentProcessingService. It was implementing a Service Registry pattern allowing for adding support for new file formats. Adding support consisted of writing a new web application that was exposing methods for:\n\n\nreturning metadata - which formats with which options were supported,\n\n\nextracting sentences (with their positions) from file,\n\n\ninserting translations for text inside sentences (usually just for words).\n\n\nThen, we're supposed to add it's url into database so that backend could know about support for new format.\nAfter having sentences extracted, on the backend part, words from sentences were extracted and analyzed using custom text analyzer.\nA note on parsing\nFor generating parsers we used great ANTLR toolset. Writing grammars and using resulting parsers was a pleasure comparing to my university experience with Bison/Flex. Actually the whole SRT grammar was quite simple, here is the lexer part:\nlexer grammar SRTLexer;\nTIMESPAN: TIME ARROW TIME -&gt; pushMode(TEXT);\n \nTIME: NUMBER NUMBER ':' NUMBER NUMBER ':' NUMBER NUMBER ',' NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER ;\nID: NUMBER+; \nNUMBER: '0'..'9' ;\nNEWLINE: '\\r'? '\\n';\nARROW: ' --&gt; ' ;\nmode TEXT;\n\nCAPTION: LINE+ -&gt; popMode;\nLINE: ~[\\r\\n]+ END -&gt; skip;\nEND: '\\r'? '\\n' -&gt; skip;\n\n\nand parser part:\nparser grammar SRTParser;\noptions { tokenVocab = SRTLexer; }\n\nfile: (subtitle NEWLINE) + subtitle NEWLINE ? EOF;\nsubtitle: ID NEWLINE TIMESPAN CAPTION NEWLINE*;\n\nConclusion\nIf you found anything of this interesting, you can drop me a message. Parsers part is available on Github, but please have in mind that it doesn't contain history (as the development was happening on a private Bitbucket account): WTM-Harbors.\n","id":"https://lukiasz.github.io/blog/wtm-technicalities/","title":"Way To Master - Technical Details"},"https://lukiasz.github.io/main/":{"body":"Hello, World!\n","id":"https://lukiasz.github.io/main/","title":"Main"},"https://lukiasz.github.io/pages/":{"body":"","id":"https://lukiasz.github.io/pages/","title":""},"https://lukiasz.github.io/recommendations/":{"body":"Books\nI read books. They inspire and force me to find a quiet place and dedicate time into them. It does pay off. Here you'll find some of my recommendations. \n\nFacts and Fallacies of Software Engineering — Robert L. Glass\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    A book with a series of commonly ommited facts and commonly commited fallacies in the software engineering industry. Among other things, you'll learn:\n\nwhy you should always aim at hiring the best programmers for your project,\nwhy very often it's not worth building reusable components,\nthat unstable requirements and poor estimations are the most common causes of a runaway project,\nthat there is no data demonstrating that \"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\" is true.\n\nWhat's important, every fact and fallacy is backed up by refferred whitepapers. So it's not a book written by an enlightened self-made programming guru - it's a summary of the collective research in IT industry.\n    \n\n\n\nThe Everyday Parenting Toolkit: The Kazdin Method for Easy, Step-by-Step, Lasting Change for You and Your Child — Alan E. Kazdin\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    The only book I've read about rearing children, so far. It presents author's own ABC method that is used to change child behavior. What does that mean? For example, let's say you have a problem because your little one doesn't clean his teeth. This book will teach you effective, science-based method that you can apply to make cleaning teeth happening. And the same method you can apply to many other problems that you and your children will encounter. It will also teach you why punishments are not effective, why you shouldn't repeat yourself over and over, why explaining things may not work, why you can't spoil your kid by giving him praises and many others. There is also related course on Coursera.\n    \n\n\n\nDeveloping Management Skills — David Whetten and Kim Cameron\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Pretty demanding and time-consuming management book. Prepare to spend a couple of months on it. This isn't an easy ready, but it's so comprehensive and so damn good... Basically it gives you a set of tools and models for you everyday work as a manager. Everything is pretty well backed up by liteally hundreds of references. A lot of psychology, DOs, DONTs, fallacies, examples, stories. Every manager should read it and everyone working with others will benefit from it.\n    \n\n\n\nModern Operating Systems — Andrew Tanenbaum and Herbert Bos\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    This book I would recommend to everyone who is involved in complex applications design. I have read it after my graduation, it has been a long journey reading it but and I don't regret any single hour spend on it.\nOne might ask - \"why learning operating systems?\" The reason is that operating systems are hosts for your applications (assuming you're not writing bare-metal software). By knowing all the basics how do they work, you will know how to write code that is really performant. Or cheap in terms of running in cloud resources. Also, I enjoyed to read how complex beasts operating systems in the modern world actually are. Dozens of problems that are explained in the book were feeling close to me but on a different level - for example, instead of thinking about CPU L1 vs L2 cache, I had to worry about in-proc vs Redis performance in one of my projects. There are a lot of analogies between operating systems and service-oriented-architecture (microservices) that I could only find by reading this book.\n    \n\n\n\nA Philosophy of Software Design — John Ousterhout\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    A great title about programming written by the creator of Tcl language. The book focuses around designing modules and fighting with complexity. It provides very good arguments against many popular \"good practices\" that end up to be problematic once you start working on more complex and bigger codebases. Read it especially if you're fan of Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) positions because it provides counter arguments against some of his recommendations.\n    \n\n\n\nSoftware Requirements — Karl Wiegers and Joy Beatty\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    A book about software requirements. Was very helpful for me to understand different level of requirements - scope &amp; vision, business requirements, user requirements, functional requirements and so on. Unstable and poorly designed requirements are too common among our industry; there are high chances that sooner or later you'll have to face it in your career. This book will help you having better requirements and great requirements-related conversations with people who are not developers.\n    \n\n\n\nSoftware Estimation: Demystifying the Black Art — Steve McConnell\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    If you want to estimate effectively, this is the only book you need to read. After reading it, I became comfortable with discussing estimates, plans and commitments with other. I became more assertive and less emotional when discussing tight deadlines and late projects. It really helped me and I cannot recommend it more.\n    \n\n\n\nOn Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction — William Zinsser\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    That book helped me communicating better using writing in my workplace and beyond. Emails, documentations, articles, notes. I'm thinking on paper and I found that book helping me a lot in, well, thinking more clearly.\nYou'll also find some useful analogies applicable to writing software.\n    \n\n\nMOOCs\n\nHow To Build a Startup,\nFoundations of Professional Identity\nModel Thinking\nLearning How To Learn\nSoftware Security\nSocial Psychology\n\n","id":"https://lukiasz.github.io/recommendations/","title":"Recommendations"}},"docInfo":{"https://lukiasz.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://lukiasz.github.io/about/":{"body":216,"title":0},"https://lukiasz.github.io/blog/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://lukiasz.github.io/blog/iterating-on-concept/":{"body":283,"title":5},"https://lukiasz.github.io/blog/perfect-code/":{"body":320,"title":2},"https://lukiasz.github.io/blog/wtm-post-mortem/":{"body":979,"title":5},"https://lukiasz.github.io/blog/wtm-technicalities/":{"body":800,"title":4},"https://lukiasz.github.io/main/":{"body":2,"title":1},"https://lukiasz.github.io/pages/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://lukiasz.github.io/recommendations/":{"body":498,"title":1}},"length":10},"lang":"English"};
