# Books
{% capture currentyear %}{{ 'now' | date: "%Y" }}{% endcapture %}

In {{ currentyear }}, I do still believe in learning from books. They inspire me, force me to focus, to find a quiet place and to dedicate my time into them. And with the assumption that we're talking about worthful positions, it does pay off. Here you'll find some of my recommendations. 

I'm reading books on physical paper, on Onyx Max Boox Pro 2, Kindle Whitepaper 2 and my phone. More about my reading-learning setup soon.
