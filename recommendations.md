Here are some of things that I found useful at some point in my life.


# Books

In fast-paced world full of video tutorials, blogs, courses, one may say - why reading books? And my answer is: because they inspire and make me to think as nothing else does plus they're pretty convinient.

To read properly a book, I need to focus, have a quiet place, and invest in it. And it does pays off. I love reading books about eternal, lifelong concepts, about ideas that are transferrable between jobs and positions. Here you'll find some of my recommendations.

I'm reading books on physical paper, on Onyx Max Boox Pro 2, Kindle Whitepaper 2 and my phone. More about my reading-learning setup soon.
