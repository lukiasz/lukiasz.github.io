<p>It's usually mentioned in the context of discussing Agile vs Waterfall to make an argument that we should iteratively build a product that solves some business needs from some early days rather than create a software that won't render any value unless fully finished. But is it always the case? Is delivering <em>some</em> value early always the best way of developing software?</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h2 id="the-cost-of-delivering-early">The cost of delivering early</h2>
<p>Some people tend to think:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let's do a skateboard to make customer somewhat happy, phase 1, and we'll think later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>without considering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is spending time on designing and implementing skateboard... then scooter... then bicycle... then bike... really the fastest way to build a car?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've seen couple of times a temptation of focusing on intermediate, easy checkpoint while purposefully avoiding thinking about the end goal.</p>
<p>In those cases, eagerness of delivering something working makes us forget that the overall process of making rollerskate -&gt; scooter -&gt; bicycle -&gt; bike -&gt; car will take more resources than doing just a car at the beginning. It's simply more work to build all of those things in-between.</p>
<p>What's even more, business people like to underestimate cost of rework happening in-between when iterating on live product. They think like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;- ok, let's build rollerskate, <strong>it's simple</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;- now, add handlebar, <strong>it's simple</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;- now we have bike, it looks like we need to add two more wheels and that will be a car!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They don't realize that a lot of internals will be rewritten in-between. And developers sometimes don't make it explicit, because they also don't think about that, they like jumping into code sooner than later. It's also motivating for everyone to see <em>some</em> tangible, working things early.</p>
<p>The only problem is that this approach, unfortunately, is very expensive. It's called <em>iterating on code</em>.</p>
<h2 id="iterating-on-concept-vs-iterating-on-code">Iterating on concept vs iterating on code</h2>
<p>Iterating On Code goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Design feature</li>
<li>Implement feature</li>
<li>Feedback loop</li>
<li>(go to point 1)</li>
</ol>
<p>The slowest point is point number 2. You can iterate faster if you take coding out of the loop when prototyping a new feature/product.</p>
<p>That would be something like steps below. It's called Iterating On Concept:</p>
<ol>
<li>Design feature</li>
<li>Prototype</li>
<li>Feedback loop</li>
<li>(go to point 1)</li>
<li>Implement final version of the feature</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, there are cases when it's not possible. There are cases when you need to iterate on code. There are cases that you will build rollerskate, then scooter, bicycle, bike to end up building a car. Sometimes it's the only way to discover what to do next. But it's not always the case. In many, many situations you should hold your horses. Don't jump straight into development but stay longer in design and prototyping phases. Don't be lazy. Iterate on concept whenever possible.</p>
