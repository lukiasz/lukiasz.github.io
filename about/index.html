        <p>My name is Łukasz Olender and I'm a 33 years old computer programmer living in Chorzów, Poland.</p>

<p>I was born here on 13th of November 1990. I have three siblings -- I'm the oldest one. I had a beautiful childhood during which I've spent a lot of time on the countryside, in a small summerhouse in moutains.</p>
<p>On 1998, I started my 12 years long music journey by signing up to Music School. Such an endeavor shaped me a lot. While I'm not considering myself a professional musican, I do think that I'm pretty good at time management because of extra time pressure that was on me since my early school days. Besides that, I can play clarinet pretty well - I was first clarinetist in city folk band (Zespół Pieśni i Tańca Chorzów) and in municipal orchestra of Chorzów (Miejska Orkiestra Chorzów). As of today, sometimes I still play clarinet but not as often as I used to. I'm also not practicing regularly.</p>
<p>I studied Computer Science at the Silesian University Of Technology in Gliwice. I graduated in 2013. I have Master Degree.</p>
<p>Apart from University, I was loving MOOCs (well, I still love them but don't have time for them anymore). I finished &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; by Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig from Stanford University in the fall of 2011. I think that was one of first MOOCs ever.</p>

</figure>
<p>I participated in many MOOCs, some of them completed, some of them only partially finished. See my <a href="/recommendations">recommendations page</a>!</p>
<p>During my University adventure, I also took an opportunity to create a small startup about which you can read <a href="/blog/wtm-post-mortem">here</a> and <a href="/blog/wtm-technicalities">here</a>.</p>
<p>Starting from January 2012 I started my career as a software developer in Euvic. In 2016 I moved to Shiji where I work now as technical leader of a team of 18.</p>
<p>I like everything connected to software development - from low-level algorithms and data structures to modeling high-level business concepts. From fine-tuned imperative procedures, to big object-oriented services playing well together. I led and developed a couple of interesting projects about which you can read in my CV.</p>
<p>Besides programming, I love skiing, playing casual songs on piano, hiking and roller-skating. I wish I had more time 😊</p>
