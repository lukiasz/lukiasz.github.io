My name is Łukasz Olender and I'm a 31 years old computer programmer living in Chorzów, Poland.

I was born here on 13th of November 1990. I had a beautiful childhood during which I've spent a lot of time on the countryside.

On 1998, I started my 12 years long music journey by signing up to Music School. Such an endeavor shaped me a lot. While I'm not considering myself a professional musican, I do think that I'm pretty good at time management because of extra time pressure that was on me since my early school days. Besides that, I can play clarinet pretty well - I was first clarinetist in city folk band (Zespół Pieśni i Tańca Chorzów) and municipal orchestra (Miejska Orkiestra Chorzów). As of today, sometimes I still play clarinet but not as often as I used to. I'm also not practicing regularly.

I studied Computer Science at the Silesian University Of Technology in Gliwice. I graduated in 2013. I have Master Degree.

Apart from University, I was loving MOOCs (well, I still love them but have less time nowadays :)). I finished "Artificial Intelligence" by Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig from Stanford University in the fall of 2011. I think that was one of first MOOCs ever.

I participated in many MOOCs, some of them completed, some of them only partially finished. See my [recommendations page](/recommendations)!


During my University adventure, I also took an opportunity to create a small startup about which you can read [here](/wtm-post-mortem) and [here](wtm-technicalities).

Starting from January 2012 I started my career as a software developer in Euvic. I still have many friends there!
In 2016 I moved to Shiji where I work now.

I love skiing, playing piano, hiking, and everything connected to software development - from low-level algorithms and data structures to high-level business concepts. From imperative procedures, to OOP modules. I love functional programming. On a daily basis I work with C# codebase.
