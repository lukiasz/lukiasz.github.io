### Developing Management Skills
#### *-- by David Whetten and Kim Cameron*

Pretty demanding and time-consuming management book. Prepare to spend a couple of months on it. This isn't an easy ready, but it's so comprehensive and so damn good... Basically it gives you a set of tools and models for you everyday work as a manager. Everything is pretty well backed up by liteally hundreds of references. A lot of psychology, DOs, DONTs, fallacies, examples, stories. Every manager should read it and everyone working with others will benefit from it.
