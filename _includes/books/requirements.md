### Software Requirements
#### *-- by Karl Wiegers and Joy Beatty*

A book about software requirements. Was very helpful for me to understand different level of requirements - scope & vision, business requirements, user requirements, functional requirements and so on. Unstable and poorly designed requirements are too common among our industry; there are high chances that sooner or later you'll have to face it in your career. This book will help you having better requirements and great requirements-related conversations with people who are not developers.
