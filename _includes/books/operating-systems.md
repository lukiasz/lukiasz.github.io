### Modern Operating Systems
#### *-- by Andrew Tanenbaum and Herbert Bos*

This book I would recommend to everyone who is involved in complex applications design. I have read it after my graduation, it has been a long journey reading it but and I don't regret any single hour spend on it.

One might ask - "why learning operating systems?" The reason is that operating systems are hosts for your applications (assuming you're not writing bare-metal software). By knowing all the basics how do they work, you will know how to write code that is really performant. Or cheap in terms of running in cloud resources. Also, I enjoyed to read how complex beasts operating systems in the modern world actually are. Dozens of problems that are explained in the book were feeling close to me but on a different level - for example, instead of thinking about CPU L1 vs L2 cache, I had to worry about in-proc vs Redis performance in one of my projects. There are a lot of analogies between operating systems and service-oriented-architecture (microservices) that I could only find by reading this book.
