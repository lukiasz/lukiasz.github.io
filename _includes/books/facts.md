### Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering
#### *-- by Robert L. Glass*

A book with a series of commonly ommited facts and commonly commited fallacies in the software engineering industry. Among other things, you'll learn:
  * why you should always aim at hiring the best programmers for your project,
  * why very often it's not worth building reusable components,
  * that unstable requirements and poor estimations are the most common causes of a runaway project,
  * that there is no data demonstrating that "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow" is true.

What's important, every fact and fallacy is backed up by refferred whitepapers. So it's not a book written by an enlightened self-made programming guru - it's a summary of the collective research in IT industry.
