### A Philosophy of Software Design
#### *-- by  John Ousterhout*

A great title about programming written by the creator of Tcl language. The book focuses around designing modules and fighting with complexity. It provides very good arguments against many popular "good practices" that end up to be problematic once you start working on more complex and bigger codebases. Read it especially if you're fan of Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) positions because it provides counter arguments against some of his recommendations.
